The AxonServer Connector for .NET serves the purpose of connecting CLR based application
to [AxonServer](https://axoniq.io/product-overview/axon-server).

As such it aims to provide a clean and clear solution that ties into
the [AxonServer API](https://github.com/AxonIQ/axon-server-api), which is written
in [ProtoBuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers). It would thus allow a straightforward connection with
AxonServer.
